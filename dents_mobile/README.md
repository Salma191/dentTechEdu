# Getting Started

>**Note**: Make sure you have completed the [React Native - Environment Setup](https://reactnative.dev/docs/environment-setup) instructions till "Creating a new application" step, before proceeding.

## Step 1: Install the dependecies

First, you will need to Install the dependecies

To Install them, run the following command from the _root_ of your React Native project:

```bash
# using npm
npm install
```

## Step 2: Start your Application



### For Android

```Android studio
open the app on Android studio
change the ip adress in the config.js
Run the emulator

npx react-native start --reset-cache
Use a to run the app on android 
```


If everything is set up _correctly_, you should see your new app running in your _Android Emulator_  shortly provided you have set up your emulator/simulator correctly.
